# GrainTrackerMerge

The GrainTrackerMerge class is a derived class based on [GrainTracker](/GrainTracker.md), which is used to perform the merge operation when two grains have the same crystallographic orientation or the orientation difference is lower than a certain threshold during grain growth.

## Calculate the misoriention angle based on Euler angles

TODO

ps. This part can be done at the end
<!-- In this part, I can provide the calculation method based on the rotation matrix, but I have not fully understood it based on the quaternion -->

## a simple example using VT modeling



## a simple example using EBSD data

ps. This part will be executed after finishing the previous test
